# Introduction:
With the increasing use of fitness tracking devices and smartwatches, large amounts of health-related data are being generated every day. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze fitness tracker data and build predictive models.
The aim of the project is to analyze Calories Burned and Fitness Information of people under age of 45 based on the Age, Distance, Duration, Steps, HeartRate, Calories, the DataSet is created on Random basis which is not obtained from any websites.

# This project follows machine learning pipeline, including:
  Data preprocessing (handling missing values, filtering)
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using plots
  Model training with multiple regression models
  Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

It explores how well different machine learning models can Analyze people's Age, and compares their performance to determine the best fit.
This project demonstrates the end-to-end application of machine learning techniques in the field of personal health and fitness analytics. By analyzing real-world data collected from fitness trackers, we aimed to predict the user's Age based on various physiological and activity-related metrics such as steps walked, heart rate, calories burned, distance, and duration of activity.
Through systematic data preprocessing, including handling missing values and filtering out older users for a focused analysis (Age < 45), we ensured the data quality was maintained for reliable model training. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided valuable insights into how different fitness parameters are distributed and how they relate to each other.
We trained and evaluated seven regression models, ranging from simple Linear Regression to more complex models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. The results showed that ensemble-based models such as Random Forest and XGBoost significantly outperformed others in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization, achieving the lowest RMSE and highest R² scores.

# Key takeaways include:
Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best model, capable of capturing non-linear relationships and handling feature interactions effectively.
Simpler models like Linear Regression performed adequately but lacked the sophistication to capture complex patterns in the data.
Neural Networks (MLPRegressor) provided decent performance but required more tuning and computational effort.
The K-Nearest Neighbors model, while easy to implement, was more sensitive to the scaling and noise in the dataset.
The predictive ability of these models proves that fitness tracker data can serve as a reliable indicator of demographic factors like age. This kind of analysis can be extended to build personalized health insights, such as estimating fitness level, identifying anomalies in activity patterns, or even predicting potential health risks.

# From a real-world application standpoint, this project lays the groundwork for integrating AI/ML into:
  Healthcare monitoring apps
  Smart fitness coaching systems
  Age-appropriate fitness recommendations
  Personalized health dashboards
